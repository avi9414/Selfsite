										<h3>WHO I AM? </h3>
										<p align="justify"> I’m tinkerer, tuner and tamperer who’s been around the block. <br/>

<center><quote>“Rush kills creativity | Slow down.“</quote></center><br/>

I’m a slow but steady learner , a die-hard cricket fan(Dhoni sabka baap hai), playing Basketball since childhood (NBA is in the blood), trying to learn chords of guitar(not for getting girls :p ).<br/>

Photography and Music where I find my peace always. I didn’t own a DSLR but have firm faith in my Moto G4+ (lol) and like to upload my better photography at 500px. In Music, I love to listen classic Bollywood 90s to Arijit Singh, from One Direction to Linkin Park (Chester forever) to Taylor Swift. Punjabi Songs comes to my rescue every time I need to keep my sleepy eyes open.<br/>

I always prefer taking a nap over talking to people. Yeah !! I am kinda introvert or you can say living in my own world. Fashion is something I don’t have any knowledge of but yeah love my beard. Reading is something I always cherish in my free time (especially in train and metro rides where phone never buzzes to disturb you due to network issues). I am a big foodie and loves to travel (dream: India Tour & Iceland). Aurora Borealis is something I love to view once in my lifetime.<br/>

A big movie freak (Hogwarts & Harry & Hermione, Paul Walker & Vin Diesel). Yeah !! I prefer HIMYM(How I Met Your Mother) over F.R.I.E.N.D.S (Ted Mosby ❤ ).<br/>

Netflix has got no chill: Lost in Space(Will Robinson ❤ ), 13 Reasons Why (Hanna Baker & Clay Jenson), Sherlock, Salvation( Liam Cole ❤ ), Rick & Morty.<br/>

Amazon Prime following the paths to Netflix: Startup (currently watching).<br/>

Wanna discuss any of these things mentioned over a cup of coffee or beer, ping me anywhere on any social media platform :p.<br/>

<h3>Education</h3>
<p align="justify">I am Computer Science Undergraduate Student from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida. Currently working as Web Developer Intern at SADRAG and available for freelance. I did my schooling from my hometown ALLAHABAD (Jagat Taran Golden Jubilee School).</p>
									

<h3>Interest Areas</h3>
<p align="justify">I am interested in the web as a platform for creative expression. I stand on a sweet spot where design and code intersects. Advancements in the hardware and in native web technologies have given rise to endless possibilities and I am on the path to explore this space. I have greatly enjoyed exploring this space so far, and there is plenty left to discover. <br/>

“Without Data, the world will get perished and without visualization data is nothing.”<br/>

With this motive, I am trying to explore the domain of Data Science and Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence(Yeah!! I also got the motivation from J.A.R.V.I.S :p). Currently trying to implement Tensorflow on Raspberry Pi. Bots always attract me like magnets so I tried exploring this field making some cool projects. Check my Github repository for the projects. Wanna ask questions related to Autonomous Line Followers, Arduino, sensors like NRF, Bluetooth etc can ping me anytime.</p>
									
<h3>About this website</h3>
<p align="justify">As you can see, English is not my native language. You may find some grammar errors if so, please contact me.<br/>
The goal of this blog is to talk about things I’m working on whether it’s serious stuff or jokey stuff.<br/>
Creativity is my addiction. Thanks for reading this far. In exchange of your seemingly undying loyalty, here is a joke:<br/>
” Why CV is called CV? Because it’s always Ctrl + C and then Ctrl +V LOL”<br/></p>
